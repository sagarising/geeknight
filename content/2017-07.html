    title: Dr. Culture Shock: Or how I stopped worrying and loved Org culture
    subtitle: The org culture mantra is usually considered a silicon valley mumbo jumbo.  Although many companies and teams rant about culture, very few in my opinion take it seriously.  In this talk I would like to discuss the importance of Org culture and how it makes or breaks businesses and teams.  I will lay out some key pointers that will help the influencers in the audience make decisions about their org or team culture.  The talk will be in the context of culture in tech companies.
