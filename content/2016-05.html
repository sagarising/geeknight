    title: Backends for frontends
    subtitle: If you're designing an API for mobile from scratch, you're lucky. But what if your mobile apps need to fit into an ecosystem that has been around for years? In this talk, we'll look at some patterns that can help solve these problems. How can mobile clients consume APIs originally designed for Desktop-based websites? How can we maintain consistency in business logic across different mobile platforms? What happens to users who don't upgrade their apps? Can we maintain compatibility and fix bugs?

    title: "Getting your applications ready for Android N"
    subtitle: Google has started releasing previews for Android N, and will finalise APIs and behaviour by June. There are major changes that are happening on Android N, not only on the UI, but even at an architectural level. In this talk, we aim to cover two critical changes in behaviour - Multi Window, and Background Optimisations. We will discuss what behavioural changes Android is making in these two areas, and how we can get our applications ready for these. If time permits, we'll brush over some other topics.
