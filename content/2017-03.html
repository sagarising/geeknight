    title: Building Intelligence into Applications
    subtitle: How can we get more out of something? This is true even with applications. Rather than just building an application, we must start building intelligence into our applications. But what does an intelligent application mean? It could mean that the application is able to anticipate moves and ‘react’ accordingly or reduce manual intervention where decisions are to be made using automated processes.

    title: IOT - from connectivity to smartness
    subtitle: Internet of Things market is growing rapidly with billions of devices being connected every year. One can expect just any "thing" around him / her to be connected, monitored and controlled over the network, thanks to the new technology. As connectivity at scale becomes ubiquitous and affordable a whole new range of untapped devices / objects turn into valuable sources of data for businesses. Making "sense" of this huge volumes of data is a non-trivial problem. Enabling dramatically faster data processing for drawing insights to facilitate faster and "Smarter" decision making is critical for businesses to gain competitive edge. This talk will explore the challenges and approaches of making this possible.
